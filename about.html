               <h3>Who am I?</h3>
               <p>
                  If you're reading this, that means that you wondering who am I? I'm a New York-based artist who creates art through my camera and then my art creating a related (depend on shot) mood in the place where you'll hang it... eventually, it's up to you how you'll use the shot, but my personal belief that each and every shot should be seen by as many people as it's possible. Tyler the Creator named the whole album in my honor, Igor. I've been born and raised in Ukraine and moved to NY 4 years ago. You are welcome to book a photoshoot with me through the site or call/txt me by the number in the top right corner.
